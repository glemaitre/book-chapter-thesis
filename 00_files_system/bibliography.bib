  Abstract                 = {T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used for pretreatment work-up for prostate cancer, but its accuracy for the detection and localization of prostate cancer is unsatisfactory. To improve the utility of MR imaging for diagnostic evaluation, various other techniques may be used. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging allows an assessment of parameters that are useful for differentiating cancer from normal tissue. The advantages of this technique include the direct depiction of tumor vascularity and, possibly, obviation of an endorectal coil; however, there also are disadvantages, such as limited visibility of cancer in the transitional zone. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates the restriction of diffusion and the reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient values in cancerous tissue. This technique allows short acquisition time and provides high contrast resolution between cancer and normal tissue, but individual variability in apparent diffusion coefficient values may erode diagnostic performance. The accuracy of MR spectroscopy, which depicts a higher ratio of choline and creatine to citrate in cancerous tissue than in normal tissue, is generally accepted. The technique also allows detection of prostate cancer in the transitional zone. However, it requires a long acquisition time, does not directly depict the periprostatic area, and frequently is affected by artifacts. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation in which both functional and anatomic MR imaging techniques are used with an understanding of their particular advantages and disadvantages may help improve the accuracy of MR for detection and localization of prostate cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Familiarity with normal anatomy is critical to interpretation of imaging of the prostate and peri-prostatic structures. This is especially true for MR imaging, which depicts these structures with exquisite detail due to high spatial resolution, superior contrast resolution, multiplanar capability, and large field of view. Anatomic understanding plays a key role in the assessment and management of prostatic disease, and allows evaluation of anatomic disturbances that may result from prostatic disease or therapy, and which may have functional consequences, particularly for continence and potency.}

  Abstract                 = {Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis are considered in the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. Alternatives to the usual maximum likelihood (plug-in) estimates for the covariance matrices are proposed. These alternatives are characterized by two parameters, the values of which are customized to individual situations by jointly minimizing a sample-based estimate of future misclassification risk. Computationally fast implementations are presented, and the efficacy of the approach is examined through simulation studies and application to data. These studies indicate that in many circumstances dramatic gains in classification accuracy can be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {MR images of the male pelvis in 55 subjects were analyzed retrospectively for depiction of the zonal anatomy of the prostate gland as related to different repetition (TR) and echo (TE) times, slice thickness, plane of imaging, chronologic age of the patient, and different magnetic field strengths. With imagers operating at 0.35 and 1.5 T, T2-based tissue-contrast images were needed for the demonstration of the internal anatomy of the prostate gland. The display of zonal anatomy was improved when continuous 0.5-cm slices were used. Evaluating sequential sections, the peripheral, central, and transition zones could be differentiated. The peripheral zone showed higher signal intensity than either the central or transition zone and was discerned in the coronal, sagittal, and transverse planes. The central zone was of low signal intensity and was well displayed in the coronal and sagittal planes. The central zone was seen in 31 of the 32 young men (aged 25-35 years) but in only eight of the 23 older men (aged 40 years and older). The transition zone had intrinsic MR parameters similar to the central zone, and the two could be distinguished from each other only by the knowledge of their respective anatomic location. The low-intensity transition zone blended with the periurethral glands and the preprostatic sphincter. The transition zone was of homogeneous low signal intensity in young men but varied in size and signal intensity in older men. Such a detailed display of the prostate zonal anatomy offers a unique potential for the evaluation of prostatic physiology and disease.}

  Abstract                 = {{Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Markov Random Fields in Image Segmentation provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Markovian modeling in image segmentation as well as a brief overview of recent advances in the field. Segmentation is formulated within an image labeling framework, where the prob- lem is reduced to assigning labels to pixels. In a probabilistic approach, label dependencies are modeled by Markov random fields (MRF) and an optimal labeling is determined by Bayes- ian estimation, in particular maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The main advantage of MRF models is that prior information can be imposed locally through clique potentials. MRF models usually yield a non-convex energy function. The minimization of this function is crucial in order to find the most likely segmentation according to the MRF model. Classical optimiza- tion algorithms including simulated annealing and deterministic relaxation are treated along with more recent graph cut-based algorithms. The primary goal of this monograph is to demonstrate the basic steps to construct an eas- ily applicable MRF segmentation model and further develop its multi-scale and hierarchical implementations as well as their combination in a multilayer model. Representative exam- ples from remote sensing and biological imaging are analyzed in full detail to illustrate the applicability of these MRF models.}},

  Abstract                 = {Earlier morphologic studies of the prostate, though often extensive, have never systematically delineated its completed structure. Recent comprehensive analysis of 500 prostates has more precisely defined its anatomic composition, identifying previously undetected features and unsuspected complexities. Using a three-dimensional model, these structures and relationships are demonstrated. Four basic anatomic regions are described. The relationship of each to the urethra provides a central anatomic reference point. 1. The peripheral zone constitutes over 70% of the glandular prostate. It forms a disc of tissue whose ducts radiate laterally from the urethra lateral and distal to the verumontanum. Almost all carcinomas arise here. 2. The central zone constitutes 25% of the glandular prostate. Its ducts arise close to the ejaculatory duct orifices and follow these ducts proximally, branching laterally near the prostate base. Its lateral border fuses with the proximal peripheral zone border, completing in continuity with the peripheral zone, a full disc of secretory tissue oriented in a coronal plane. Marked histologic differences between central and peripheral zones suggest important biologic differences. 3. Preprostatic region. The urethral segment proximal to the verumontanum is kinked anteriorly at a 35-degree angle to the distal segment. No major ducts arise in the proximal segment, but the lateral rows of peripheral zone orifices continue. Duct development is aborted here, producing only a small transition zone and several tinier periurethral ducts. The development of these small ducts is possibly determined and limited by their intimate relationship to a periurethral smooth muscle sphincter that exists only proximal to the verumontanum. These small ducts in a restricted area are the exclusive site of nodular hyperplasia (BPH) origin. 4. The anterior fibromuscular stroma forms the entire anterior surface of the prostate as a thick, nonglandular apron, shielding from view the anterior surface of the three glandular regions. Its inseparable fusion to the glandular prostate has probably delayed recognition of the anatomic features described here.}

The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.}

  Abstract                 = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}

  Abstract                 = {Feature selection techniques have become an apparent need in many bioinformatics applications. In addition to the large pool of techniques that have already been developed in the machine learning and data mining fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have led to a wealth of newly proposed techniques.In this article, we make the interested reader aware of the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of feature selection techniques, and discussing their use, variety and potential in a number of both common as well as upcoming bioinformatics applications.Contact: yvan.saeys@psb.ugent.beSupplementary information: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/supplementary_data/yvsae/fsreview}

  Abstract                 = {Current understanding of the anatomic subdivision of the adult prostate gland is secondary to two major studies successively published by Gil Vernet in 1953 and by McNeal in 1968. In Gil Vernet's report, glandular tissue consists of a caudal gland, a cranial gland and a intermediate gland. These 3 glandular areas were defined according to the location of their glandular openings into the urethra. In McNeal's report, the urethra is taken as the primary anatomic reference point. The four glandular areas are best visualized by examination of the selected coronal plane of sections along the proximal and distal prostatic urethra. The peripheral zone is located posterolaterally, the central zone is located at the base, and the 2 lobes of the transition zone are located along the proximal urethra. Fibromuscular regions are concentrated anteromedially. Most of the anatomic regions are similar between the two models, however, in McNeal's model, accuracies concerning the boundaries of the central zone and transition zone ultimately make this model superior for the study of both the physiology and pathology of the prostate.}
