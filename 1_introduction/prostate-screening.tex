\subsection{\acs*{cap} screening and imaging techniques}\label{sec:intro:screening}

Current \ac{cap} screening consists of three different stages.
First, \ac{psa} control is performed to distinguish between low- and high-risk
\ac{cap}.
To assert such diagnosis, samples are taken during prostate biopsy and finally
analyzed to evaluate the prognosis and the stage of \ac{cap}.
In this section, we present a detailed description of the current screening as
well as its drawbacks.

Since its introduction in mid-1980s, \ac{psa} is widely used for \ac{cap}
screening~\cite{Etzioni2002}.
A higher-than-normal level of \ac{psa} can indicate an abnormality of the
prostate either as a \ac{bph} or a cancer~\cite{Hoeks2011}.
However, other factors can lead to an increased \ac{psa} level such as prostate
infections, irritations, a recent ejaculation, or a recent rectal
examination~\cite{Parfait2010}.
\ac{psa} is found in the bloodstream in two different forms: free \ac{psa}
accounting for about \SI{10}{\percent} and linked to another protein for the
remaining \SI{90}{\percent}.
A level of \ac{psa} higher than \SI{10}{\nano\gram\per\milli\liter} is
considered to be at risk~\cite{Parfait2010}.
If the \ac{psa} level is ranging from
\SIrange{4}{10}{\nano\gram\per\milli\liter}, the patient is considered as
suspicious~\cite{Barentsz2012}.
In that case, the ratio of free \ac{psa} to total \ac{psa} is computed; if the
ratio is higher than \SI{15}{\percent}, the case is considered as
pathological~\cite{Parfait2010}.

\Iac{trus} biopsy is carried out for cases which are considered pathological.
At least 6 different samples are taken randomly from the right and left parts
of the 3 different prostate zones: apex, median, and base.
These samples are further evaluated using the Gleason grading
system~\cite{Gleason1977}.
The scoring scheme to characterize the biopsy sample is composed of 5 different
patterns which correspond to grades ranging from 1 to 5.
A higher grade is associated with a poorer prognosis~\cite{Epstein2005}.
Then, in the Gleason system, 2 scores are assigned corresponding to (i) the
grade of the most present tumour pattern, and (ii) the grade of the second most
present tumour pattern~\cite{Epstein2005}.
A higher \ac{gs} indicates a more aggressive tumour~\cite{Epstein2005}.
Also, it should be noted that biopsy is an invasive procedure which can result
in serious infection or urine retention~\cite{Hara2005,Chou2011}.

Although \ac{psa} screening has been shown to improve early detection of
\ac{cap}~\cite{Chou2011}, its lack of reliability motivates further
investigations using \ac{mri}-based \ac{cad}.
Two reliable studies --- carried out in the United States~\cite{Andriole2009}
and in Europe~\cite{Schroeder2012, Hugosson2010} --- have attempted to assess
the impact of early detection of \ac{cap}, with diverging
outcomes~\cite{Chou2011,Heidenreich2013}.
The study carried out in Europe\footnote{The \ac{ersspc} started in the 1990s
  in order to evaluate the effect of \ac{psa} screening on mortality rate.}
concluded that \ac{psa} screening reduces CaP-related mortality by
\SIrange{21}{44}{\percent}~\cite{Schroeder2012, Hugosson2010}, while the
American\footnote{The \ac{plco} cancer screening trial is carried out in the
  United States and intends to ascertain the effects of screening on mortality
  rate.} trial found no such effect~\cite{Andriole2009}.
However, both studies agree that \ac{psa} screening suffers from low
specificity, with an estimated rate of \SI{36}{\percent}~\cite{Schroder2008}.
Both studies also agree that over-treatment is an issue: decision making
regarding treatment is further complicated by difficulties in evaluating the
aggressiveness and progression of \ac{cap}~\cite{Delpierre2013}.

Hence, new screening methods should be developed with improved specificity of
detection and more accurate risk assessment (i.e., aggressiveness and
progression).
Current research is focused on identifying new biological markers to replace
\ac{psa}-based screening~\cite{Bourdoumis2010,Morgan2011,Brenner2013}.
Until such research comes to fruition, these needs can be met through
active-surveillance strategy using \ac{mpmri}
techniques~\cite{Hoeks2011,Moore2013}.
\Ac{cad} systems, which is an area of active research and forms the
focus of this chapter, can be incorporated into this screening strategy allowing
a more systematic and rigorous follow-up.

Another weakness of the current screening strategy is due to the untrustworthy
results provided by \ac{trus} biopsy.
Due to its ``blind'' nature, there is a chance of missing aggressive tumours or
detecting microfocal ``cancers'', which influences the
aggressiveness-assessment procedure~\cite{Noguchi2001}.
As a consequence, over-diagnosis is estimated at up to
\SI{30}{\percent}~\cite{Haas2007}, while missing clinically significant
\ac{cap} is estimated at up \SI{35}{\percent}~\cite{Taira2010}.
In an effort to solve both issues, alternative biopsy approaches have been
explored.
\ac{mri}/\ac{us}-guided biopsy has been shown to outperform standard \ac{trus}
biopsy~\cite{Delongchamps2013}.
There, \ac{mpmri} images are fused with \ac{us} images in order to improve
localization and aggressiveness assessment to carry out biopsies.
Human interaction plays a major role in biopsy sampling which can lead to low
repeatability; by reducing potential human errors at this stage, the \acs{cad}
framework can improve repeatability of examination.
\ac{cap} detection and diagnosis can benefit from the use of \ac{mri}-based
\acs{cad}s.

In an effort to improve the current stage of \ac{cap} diagnosis and detection,
this chapter intends to review the principles of a \ac{mpmri}-\acs{cad}
system starting by a description of the \ac{mri} modalities in
\acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:2}.

\subsection{\acs*{cad} systems for \acs*{cap}}\label{sec:intro:cad}
During the last century, physicists have focused on constantly innovating in
terms of imaging techniques assisting radiologists to improve cancer detection
and diagnosis.
However, human diagnosis still suffers from low repeatability, synonymous with
erroneous detection or interpretations of abnormalities throughout clinical
decisions~\cite{Giger2008,Hambrock2013}.
These errors are driven by two majors causes~\cite{Giger2008}: observer
limitations (e.g., constrained human visual perception, fatigue or distraction)
and the complexity of the clinical cases themselves, for instance due to
imbalanced data --- the number of healthy cases is more abundant than malignant
cases --- or overlapping structures.

Computer vision has given rise to many promising solutions, but, instead of
focusing on fully automatic computerized systems, researchers have aimed at
providing computer image analysis techniques to aid radiologists in their
clinical decisions~\cite{Giger2008}.
In fact, these investigations brought about both concepts of \ac{cade} and
\ac{cadx} grouped under the acronym \ac{cad}.
Since those first steps, evidence has shown that \ac{cad} systems enhance the
diagnosis performance of radiologists.
\citeauthor{Chan1999} reported a significant \SI{4}{\percent} improvement in
breast cancer detection~\cite{Chan1999}, which has been confirmed in later
studies~\cite{Dean2006}.
Similar conclusions have been drawn in the case of lung nodule
detection~\cite{Li2004}, colon cancer~\cite{Petrick2008}, or \ac{cap} as
well~\cite{Hambrock2013}.
\citeauthor{Chan1999} also hypothesized that \acs{cad} systems will be even
more efficient assisting inexperienced radiologists than senior
radiologists~\cite{Chan1999}.
That hypothesis has been tested by \citeauthor{Hambrock2013} and confirmed in
case of \ac{cap} detection~\cite{Hambrock2013}.
In this particular study, inexperienced radiologists obtained equivalent
performance to senior radiologists, both using \acs{cad} whereas the accuracy
of their diagnosis was significantly poorer without \ac{cad}'s help.

In contradiction with the aforementioned statement, \ac{cad} for \ac{cap} is a
young technology due to the fact that is based on a still young imaging
technology: \ac{mri}~\cite{Hegde2013}.
Indeed, four distinct \ac{mri} modalities are employed in \ac{cap} diagnosis
which have been mainly developed after the mid-1990s: (i)
\ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}~\cite{Hricak1983}, (ii)
\ac{dce}-\ac{mri}~\cite{HuchBoni1995}, (iii) \ac{mrsi}~\cite{Kurhanewicz1996},
and (iv) \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}~\cite{Scheidler1999}.
In addition, the increase of magnetic field strength in clinical settings, from
\SIrange{1.5}{3}{\tesla}, and the development of endorectal coils, both
improved image spatial resolution~\cite{Swanson2001} needed to perform more
accurate diagnosis.
It is for this matter that the development of \ac{cad} for \ac{cap} is still
lagging behind the fields stated above.

The further sections aim at first, to provide an overview of the current
state-of-the-art of \ac{cad} for \ac{cap} and later, according to the drawn
conclusions, to propose a \ac{cad} which takes advantages of \ac{mpmri}
modalities.
A review of the current proposed \ac{cad} for \ac{cap} is presented in
\acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:3}.
