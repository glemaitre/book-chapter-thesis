\subsection{\acs*{cadx}: Feature detection} \label{subsec:chp3:img-clas:CADX-fea-dec}

Discriminative features which help to recognize \ac{cap} from healthy tissue
need to be first detected.
This processing is known in computer vision as feature extraction.
However, feature extraction also refers to the name given in pattern
recognition to some types of dimension reduction methods which are later
presented.
In order to avoid confusion between these two aspects, in this survey, the
procedure ``detecting'' or ``extracting'' features from images and signals is
defined as feature detection.
This section summarizes the different features used in \ac{cad} for \ac{cap}.

\subsubsection{Image-based features}\label{subsubsec:chp3:img-clas:CADX-fea-dec:Img-fea}

This section focuses on image-based features which can be categorized into two
categories: (i) voxel-wise detection and (ii) region-wise detection.

\setenumerate{listparindent=\parindent,itemsep=10px}
\setlist{noitemsep}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]

\item[] \textbf{Voxel-wise detection in \acs*{mri}}
This strategy refers to the fact that a feature is extracted at each voxel
location.
As discussed in \acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:2}, \ac{cap} has an influence on the
\ac{si} in \ac{mpmri} images.
Therefore, intensity-based feature is the most commonly used
feature~\cite{Ampeliotis2007,Ampeliotis2008,Vos2008,rampun2016computerb,rampun2015classifying,Giannini2013,Artan2009,Artan2010,Chan2003,Langer2009,Litjens2011,Litjens2012,Litjens2014,Liu2009,Ozer2009,Ozer2010,trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic,cameron2014multiparametric,cameron2016maps,khalvati2015automated,chung2015prostate,giannini2015fully,Niaf2011,Niaf2012,lehaire2014computer,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
This feature consists in the extraction of the intensity of the \ac{mri}
modality of interest.

Edge-based features have also been used to detect \ac{si} changes but bring
additional information regarding the \ac{si} transition.
Each feature is computed by convolving the original image with an edge operator.
Three operators are commonly used: (i) Prewitt operator~\cite{Prewitt1970},
(ii) Sobel operator~\cite{Sobel1970}, and (iii) Kirsch
operator~\cite{Kirsch1971}.
These operators differ due to the kernel used which attenuates more or less the
noise.
Multiple studies used the resulting magnitude and orientation of the edges
computed in their classification
frameworks~\cite{Niaf2011,Niaf2012,Tiwari2009a,Tiwari2010,Tiwari2013,Viswanath2008,Viswanath2011,rampun2016quantitative,rampun2015computer,rampun2016computer,lehaire2014computer,khalvati2015automated,chung2015prostate,Lemaitre2016thesis}.

  \caption[Illustration of 4 different Gabor filters.]{Illustration of 4
    different Gabor filters varying their orientations $\theta$.}
  \label{fig:gabor}
\end{figure}

Gabor filters~\cite{Gabor1946,Daugman1985} offer an alternative to the usual
edge detector, with the possibility to tune the direction and the frequency of
the filter to encode a specific pattern.
A Gabor filter is defined by the modulation of a Gaussian function with a sine
wave which can be further rotated and is formalized as in
\acs{eq}\,\ref{eq:gabor}.
\begin{equation}
  g(x,y;\theta,\psi,\sigma,\gamma) = \exp \left( - \frac{x'^{2}+
      \gamma^{2}y'^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}} \right) \cos \left( 2 \pi
    \frac{x'}{\lambda} + \psi \right) \ ,
  \label{eq:gabor}
\end{equation}

\noindent with

\begin{eqnarray}
  x' & = & s\left( x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta \right) \ , \nonumber \\
  y' & = & s \left( - x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta \right) \ , \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the sinusoidal factor, $\theta$
represents the orientation of the Gabor filter, $\psi$ is the phase offset,
$\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope, $\gamma$ is the
spatial aspect ratio, and $s$ is the scale factor.
In an effort to characterize pattern and texture, a bank of Gabor filters is
usually created with different angles, scale, and frequency --- refer to
\acs{fig}\,\ref{fig:gabor} --- and then convolved with the image.
\citeauthor{Viswanath2012}~\cite{Viswanath2012},
\citeauthor{Tiwari2012}~\cite{Tiwari2012} and more recently
\citeauthor{khalvati2015automated}~\cite{khalvati2015automated} and
\citeauthor{chung2015prostate}~\cite{chung2015prostate} have designed a bank of
Gabor filters to characterized texture and edge information in
\ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} and \ac{dw}-\ac{mri} modalities.

\citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis}~\cite{Lemaitre2016thesis} used a 3D Gabor
filters bank.
3D Gabor filters~\cite{wang2005face} are not commonly used and we recall their
formulation in \acs*{eq}\,\eqref{eq:gabor3d}.

\begin{equation}
  g(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\sigma},f,\theta,\phi) = \hat{g}(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \exp(j 2 \pi f \left( x \sin \theta \cos \phi + y \sin \theta \sin \phi + z \cos \theta \right)) \ ,
  \label{eq:gabor3d}
\end{equation}

\noindent where,

\begin{equation}
  \hat{g}(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = \frac{1}{{\left(2 \pi\right)}^{\frac{3}{2}}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{y^2}{\sigma_y^2} + \frac{z^2}{\sigma_z^2} \right) \right) \ ,
  \label{eq:gabor3dgaussian}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector $\{x,y,z\}$,
$\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the standard deviation vector
$\{\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z\}$ of the 3D Gaussian envelope, $f$ is the radial
center frequency of the sine wave, $\theta$ is the elevation angle, and $\phi$
is the azimuth angle.

Additionally, \citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis}~\cite{Lemaitre2016thesis}
features based on phase congruency as proposed by\citeauthor{kovesi1999image}
are computed~\cite{kovesi1999image}.
Therefore, from a set of Log-Gabor filter bank, the orientation image, the
local weighted mean phase angle, and the phase angle are estimated at each
voxel.

Texture-based features provide other characteristics discerning \ac{cap} from
healthy tissue.
The most common texture analysis for image classification is based on the
\ac{glcm} with their related statistics which have been proposed by
\citeauthor{Haralick1973} in~\cite{Haralick1973}.
In a neighborhood around a central voxel, a \ac{glcm} is build considering each
voxel pair defined by a specific distance and angle.
Then, using the \ac{glcm}, a set of statistical features is computed as defined
in \acs{tab}~\ref{tab:glcm} and assigned to the location of the central voxel.
Therefore, $N$ --- up to 14 --- statistical maps are derived from the \ac{glcm}
analysis, one per statistics presented in \acs{tab}~\ref{tab:glcm}.
\ac{glcm} is commonly used in \ac{cad} systems, on the different \ac{mri}
modalities, namely \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, or
\ac{dw}-\ac{mri}~\cite{Antic2013,Niaf2011,Niaf2012,Tiwari2009a,Tiwari2010,Tiwari2013,Viswanath2008,Viswanath2009,Viswanath2011,Viswanath2012,trigui2016classification,rampun2015computer,rampun2016computer,rampun2016quantitative,cameron2014multiparametric,cameron2016maps,khalvati2015automated,chung2015prostate,lehaire2014computer,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
However, the statistics extracted from the \ac{glcm} across studies vary.
Along the same line, \citeauthor{rampun2016computer} extracted from
\ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}~\cite{rampun2016computer,rampun2015computer} Tamura
features~\cite{tamura1978textural} composed of three features to characterize
texture: (i) coarseness, (ii) contrast, and (iii) directionality.

\end{table}

\citeauthor{Lopes2011} used fractal analysis  and more precisely a local
estimation of the fractal dimension~\cite{Benassi1998}, to describe the texture
roughness at a specific location.
The fractal dimension is estimated through a wavelet-based method in
multi-resolution analysis.
They showed that cancerous tissues have a higher fractal dimension than healthy
tissue.

\citeauthor{Chan2003} described texture using the frequency signature via the
\acf{dct}\cite{Ahmed1974} defining a neighbourhood of
\SI[product-units=repeat]{7x7}{\px} for modalities used, namely
\ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} and \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}.
The \ac{dct} allows to decompose a portion of an image into a coefficient
space, where few of these coefficients encode the significant information.
The \ac{dct} coefficients are computed such as:

\begin{equation}
  C_{k_1,k_2} = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} p_{m,n} \cos \left[
    \frac{\pi}{M} \left( m + \frac{1}{2} \right) k_1 \right] \cos \left[
    \frac{\pi}{N} \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) k_2 \right] \ ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $C_{k_1,k_2}$ is the \ac{dct} coefficient at the position
$k_1,k_2$, $M$ and $N$ are the dimension of the neighbourhood and $p_{m,n}$ is
the pixel \ac{si} at the position $\{m,n\}$.

\citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis}~\cite{Lemaitre2016thesis} incorporated those
features in their \ac{cad} system.

Regarding other features, \citeauthor{Viswanath2012} projected
\ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} images into the wavelet space, using the Haar wavelet, and
used the resulting coefficients as features~\cite{Viswanath2012}.
\citeauthor{Litjens2011} computed the texture map based on \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}
images using a Gaussian filter bank~\cite{Litjens2011}.
Likewise, \citeauthor{rampun2016computer} employed a rotation invariant filter
bank proposed in~\cite{leung2001representing}.
The bank is composed of 48 filters including Gaussian filters, first and second
derivatives of Gaussian filters as well as Laplacian of Gaussian.

\item[] \textbf{Region-wise detection in \acs*{mri}}
Unlike the previous section, another strategy is to study a region instead of
each pixel independently.
Usually, the feature maps are computed using the method presented in
voxel-based approach followed by a step in which features are computed in some
specific delineated regions to characterize them.

The most common feature type is based on statistics and more specifically the
statistic-moments such as mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and
skewness~\cite{Ampeliotis2007,Ampeliotis2008,Tiwari2009a,Tiwari2010,Tiwari2013,Viswanath2008,Viswanath2009,Viswanath2012,rampun2016quantitative,rampun2015computer,rampun2016computer,Antic2013,Viswanath2011,Peng2013,cameron2014multiparametric,cameron2016maps,khalvati2015automated,chung2015prostate,Litjens2011,Litjens2012,Litjens2014,Niaf2011,Niaf2012,lehaire2014computer}.
Additionally, some studies extract additional statistical landmarks based on
percentiles~\cite{Vos2008a,Antic2013,Peng2013,Vos2010,Litjens2011,Litjens2012,Litjens2014,Niaf2011,Niaf2012,Vos2012,lehaire2014computer}
The percentiles to use are manually determined by observing the \ac{pdf} of the
features and checking which values allow the best to differentiate malignant
from healthy tissue.

Further statistics are computed through the use of histogram-based features.
\citeauthor{Liu2013} introduced 4 different types of histogram-based features
to characterize hand-delineated lesions~\cite{Liu2013}.
The first type corresponds to the histogram of the \ac{si} of the image.
The second type is the \ac{hog}~\cite{Dalal2005} which encodes the local shape
of the object of interest by using the distribution of the gradient
directions.
This descriptor is extracted mainly in three steps.
First, the gradient image and its corresponding magnitude and direction are
computed.
Then, the \ac{roi} is divided into cells and an oriented-based histogram is
generated for each cell.
At each pixel location, the orientation of the gradient votes for a bin of the
histogram and this vote is weighted by the magnitude of the same gradient.
Finally, the cells are grouped into blocks and each block is normalized.
The third histogram-based type used in~\cite{Liu2013} is the shape context
introduced in~\cite{Belongie2002}.
The shape context is also a way to describe the shape of an object of interest.
First, a set of points defining edges have to be detected and for each point of
each edge, a log-polar-based histogram is computed using the relative points
distribution.
The last set of histogram-based feature extracted is based on the framework
described in~\cite{Zhao2012} which is using the Fourier transform of the
histogram created via \acf{lbp}~\cite{Ojala1996}.
\Ac{lbp} is generated by comparing the value of the central pixel with its
neighbours, defined through a radius and the number of connected neighbours.
Then, in the \ac{roi}, the histogram of the \ac{lbp} distribution is computed.
The \acf{dft} of the \ac{lbp} histogram is used to make the feature invariant
to rotation.

Another subset of features are anatomical-based features and have been used
in~\cite{Litjens2012,Litjens2014,Matulewicz2013,cameron2014multiparametric,cameron2016maps}.
\citeauthor{Litjens2012} computed the volume, compactness, and sphericity
related to the given region~\cite{Litjens2012, Litjens2014}.
Additionally, \citeauthor{Litjens2014} also introduced a feature based on
symmetry in which they compute the mean of a candidate lesion as well as its
mirrored counter-part and compute the quotient as feature~\cite{Litjens2014}.
\citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis}~\cite{Lemaitre2016thesis} incorporated those
features in their \ac{cad} system.
\citeauthor{Matulewicz2013} introduced 4 features corresponding to the
percentage of tissue belonging to the regions \ac{pz}, \ac{cg}, periurethral
region, or outside the prostate region for the considered
\ac{roi}~\cite{Matulewicz2013}.
Finally, \citeauthor{cameron2016maps} defined 4 features based on morphology
and asymmetry:
(i) the difference of morphological closing and opening of the \ac{roi}, (ii)
the difference of the initial perimeter and the one after removing the
high-frequency components, (iii) the difference between the initial \ac{roi}
and the one after removing the high-frequency components, and (iv) the
asymmetry by computing the difference of the two areas splitting the \ac{roi}
by its major axes~\cite{cameron2014multiparametric,cameron2016maps}.

The last group of region-based feature is based on fractal analysis.
This group of features is based on estimating the fractal dimension which is a
statistical index representing the complexity of the analyzed texture.
\citeauthor{Lv2009} proposed two features based on fractal dimension: (i)
texture fractal dimension and (ii) histogram fractal dimension~\cite{Lv2009}.
The first feature is based on estimating the fractal dimension on the \ac{si}
of each image and thus this feature is a statistical characteristic of the
image roughness.
The second fractal dimension is estimated using the \ac{pdf} of each image and
characterizes the complexity of the \ac{pdf}.
\citeauthor{Lopes2011} proposed a 3D version to estimate the fractal dimension
of a volume using a wavelet decomposition~\cite{Lopes2011}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\acs*{dce}-based features}\label{subsubsec:chp3:img-clas:CADX-fea-dec:DCE-fea}

\ac{dce}-\ac{mri} is more commonly based on a \ac{si} analysis over time as
presented in \acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp2:imaging:dce}.
In this section, the specific features extracted for \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} analysis
are presented.

\setenumerate{listparindent=\parindent,itemsep=10px}
\setlist{noitemsep}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]

\item[] \textbf{Whole-spectra approach}
Some studies are using the whole \ac{dce} time series as feature
vector~\cite{Ampeliotis2007,Ampeliotis2008,Tiwari2012,Viswanath2008a,Viswanath2008,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
In some cases, the high-dimensional feature space is reduced using dimension
reduction methods as it will be presented in the
\acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:img-clas:CADX-fea-ext}.

  \acs*{dce}-\acs*{mri}.]{Graphical representation of the different
    semi-quantitative features used for \acs*{dce}-\acs*{mri} analysis.}
  \label{fig:dceparam}
\end{figure}

\item[] \textbf{Semi-quantitative approach}
Semi-quantitative approaches are based on mathematically modelling the \ac{dce}
time series.
The parameters modelling the signal are commonly used, mainly due to the
simplicity of their
computation~\cite{Puech2009,Mazzetti2011,Niaf2011,Niaf2012,Sung2011,trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic,lehaire2014computer,samarasinghe2016semi,giannini2015fully,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
Parameters included in semi-quantitative analysis are summarized in
\acs{tab}~\ref{tab:semiqua} and also graphically depicted in
\acs{fig}\,\ref{fig:dceparam}.
A set of time features corresponding to specific amplitude level (start,
maximum, and end) are extracted.
Then, derivative and integral features are also considered as discriminative
and are commonly computed.

\item[] \textbf{Quantitative approach}
As presented in \acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:2}, quantitative approaches correspond to
mathematical-pharmacokinetic models based on physiological exchanges.
Four different models have been used in \ac{cad} for \ac{cap} systems.
The most common model reviewed is the \textit{Brix
  model}~\cite{Artan2009,Artan2010,Sung2011,Liu2009,Ozer2009,Ozer2010,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
This model is formalized such as:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{S(t)}{S(0)} = 1 + A k_{ep} \left( \frac{\exp( -k_{ep} t ) - \exp(
      -k_{el} t )}{k_{el} - k_{ep}} \right) \ ,
  \label{eq:brixmod}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $S(\cdot)$ is the \ac{dce} signal, $A$ is the parameter
simulating the tissue properties, $k_{el}$ is the parameter related to the
first-order elimination from the plasma compartment, and $k_{ep}$ is the
parameter of the transvascular permeability.
The parameters $k_{ep}$, $k_{el}$, and $A$ are computed from the \ac{mri} data
and used as features.

Another model is Tofts model~\cite{Tofts1997} which has been used
in~\cite{Langer2009,Giannini2013,Niaf2011,Niaf2012,Mazzetti2011,lehaire2014computer,giannini2015fully,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
In this model, the \ac{dce} signal relative to the concentration is presented
as:
\begin{equation}
  C_t(t) = v_p C_p(t) + K_{trans} \int_{0}^{t} C_p(\tau) \exp( -k_{ep}(t-\tau)
  ) \ d\tau \ ,
  \label{eq:tofts}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $C_t(\cdot)$ is the concentration of the medium, $C_p(\cdot)$
is the \ac{aif} which has to be estimated independently, $K_{trans}$ is the
parameter related to the diffuse transport of media across the capillary
endothelium, $k_{ep}$ is the parameter related to the exchanges back into the
vascular space, and $v_e$ is the extravascular-extracellular space fraction
defined such that $v_e = 1 - v_p$.
In this model, parameters $K_{trans}$, $k_{ep}$, and $v_e$ are computed and
used as features.

\citeauthor{Mazzetti2011}, \citeauthor{giannini2015fully}, and
\citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis} used the Weibull
function~\cite{Mazzetti2011,Giannini2013,giannini2015fully,Lemaitre2016thesis}
which is formalized as:

\begin{equation}
  S(t) = A t \exp( -t^{B} ) \ ,
  \label{eq:weibull}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $A$ and $B$ are the two parameters which have to be inferred.

They also used another empirical model which is based on the West-like function
and named the \ac{pun}~\cite{Castorina2006}, formalized as:

\begin{equation}
  S(t) = \exp \left[ r t + \frac{1}{\beta} a_0 - r \left( \exp( \beta t ) - 1
    \right) \right] \ ,
  \label{eq:pun}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the parameters $\beta$, $a_0$ and $r$ are inferred.
For all these models, the parameters are inferred using an optimization curve
fitting approach.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\acs*{mrsi}-based features}\label{subsubsec:chp3:img-clas:CADX-fea-dec:MRSI-fea}

\setenumerate{listparindent=\parindent,itemsep=10px}
\setlist{noitemsep}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]

\item[] \textbf{Whole spectra approach in \acs*{mrsi}}
As in the case of \ac{dce} analysis, one common approach is to incorporate the
whole \ac{mrsi} spectra in the feature vector for
classification~\cite{Kelm2007,Parfait2012,Tiwari2007,Tiwari2009,Tiwari2013,Tiwari2009a,Tiwari2010,Viswanath2008a,Matulewicz2013,trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic,
Lemaitre2016thesis}.
Sometimes post-processing involving dimension reduction methods is performed to
reduce the complexity during the classification as it will be presented in
\acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:img-clas:CADX-fea-ext}.

\item[] \textbf{Quantification approach in \acs*{mrsi}}
We can reiterate that in \ac{mrsi} only few biological markers --- i.e.,
choline, creatine, and citrate metabolites --- are known to be useful to
discriminate \ac{cap} and healthy tissue.
Therefore, only the concentrations of these metabolites are considered as a
feature prior to classification.
In order to perform this quantification, 4 different approaches have been used.
\citeauthor{Kelm2007} used the following models~\cite{Kelm2007}:
QUEST~\cite{Ratiney2005}, AMARES~\cite{Vanhamme1997}, and
VARPRO~\cite{Coleman1993}.
They are all time-domain quantification methods varying by the type of
pre-knowledge embedded and the optimization approaches used to solve the
quantification problem.
Unlike the time-domain quantification approaches, \citeauthor{Parfait2012} used
the LcModel approach proposed in~\cite{Provencher1993} which solves the
optimization problem in the frequency domain.
Although \citeauthor{Parfait2012} and \citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis} used each metabolite relative concentration
individually~\cite{Parfait2012,Lemaitre2016thesis}, other authors such as \citeauthor{Kelm2007}
proposed to compute relative concentrations as the ratios of metabolites as
shown in \acs{eq}\,\ref{eq:ratio1} and \acs{eq}\,\ref{eq:ratio2}.

\begin{eqnarray}
  R_1 & = & \frac{ [ \text{Cho} ] + [ \text{Cr} ]}{[ \text{Cit} ]} \ . \label{eq:ratio1} \\
  R_2 & = & \frac{[ \text{Cit} ]}{[\text{Cho}]+[\text{Cr}]+[\text{Cit}]} \ , \label{eq:ratio2}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where $\text{Cit}$, $\text{Cho}$ and $\text{Cr}$ are the relative
concentration of citrate, choline, and creatine, respectively.

Recently \citeauthor{trigui2017automatic} used an absolute quantification
approach from which water sequences are acquired to compute the absolute
concentration of the
metabolites~\cite{trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic}.
Absolute quantification using water as reference is based on the fact that the
fully relaxed signal from water or metabolites is proportional to the number of
moles of the molecules in the voxel~\cite{gasparovic2006use}.

\item[] \textbf{Wavelet decomposition approach in \acs*{mrsi}}
\citeauthor{Tiwari2012} performed a wavelet packet
decomposition~\cite{Coifman1992} of the spectra using the Haar wavelet basis
function and use its coefficients as features.
