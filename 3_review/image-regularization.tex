% \subsection{Image regularization framework}\label{sec:chp3:img-reg}

% This section provides a review of the methods used in \acp{cad} for \ac{cap} in
% order to \emph{regularize} the \ac{mpmri} images.
% At first, we present the pre-processing methods in
% \acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3img-reg:prepro}, focusing mainly on the denoising
% and artefacts removal methods as well as standardization of \ac{si}.
% \Acl{sec}~\ref{subsec:chp3:img-reg:seg} and
% \acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:img-reg:reg} summarize the segmentation and
% registration methods, which are processes allowing the \ac{cad} to only operate
% on the prostate organ and ensuring that the \ac{mpmri} images are aligned in
% the same reference frame.

%We start with pre-processing methods, focusing mainly on the reduction of
%noise level and artefacts as well as standardization of \ac{si}, following by
%a segmentation and registration sections.
