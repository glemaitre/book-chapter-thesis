\subsection{Results reported}\label{subsec:chp3:dis:res}

As discussed previously in \ac{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:img-clas:eval-mea},
different metrics have been used to report results.
A comparison of the different methods reviewed is given depending on the metric
used in field of research and also the type of \ac{mri} scanner used,
i.e. \SI{1.5}{\tesla} or \SI{3}{\tesla}.
For each field, the \textit{best classification performance} obtained in each
study have been reported in these figures.
The results in terms of \ac{auc}-\ac{roc} are depicted in
\acs{fig}\,\ref{fig:auc}.
The results vary from \SIrange{71}{97}{\percent} for some experiments with a
\SI{1.5}{\tesla} \ac{mri} scanner and from \SIrange{77}{95}{\percent} with a
\SI{3}{\tesla} \ac{mri} scanner.

The results in regard of sensitivity and specificity are reported in
\acs{fig}\,\ref{fig:sensspec}.
In the case that the data have been collected with a \SI{1.5}{\tesla} \ac{mri}
scanner, the sensitivity ranges from \SIrange{74}{100}{\percent} and the
specificity from \SIrange{43}{93}{\percent}.
For the experiments carried out with a \SI{3}{\tesla} \ac{mri} scanner, the
sensitivity varies from \SIrange{60}{99}{\percent} and the specificity from
\SIrange{66}{100}{\percent}.
Four studies also use \ac{froc} analysis to report their results and are
reported in \ac{fig}\,\ref{fig:froc}.

\subsection{Comparison}\label{subsec:chp3:dis:com}

We would like to stress the following findings drawn during the review of the
different studies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quantitatively, it is difficult to make a fair comparison between the
  different studies reviewed.
Different factors come into play to elucidate this fact.
Mainly a lack of standardization has to be pointed out in regard to
experimental evaluation:
(i) different datasets are used during the evaluation of the frameworks
developed hindering an inter-study comparison.
The same conclusion has been recently drawn by~\cite{Litjens2014} supporting
this argument;
(ii) the experimental results are not reported with a common metric which leads
to the inability to compare the different studies.

\item \label{here} However, multiple studies reported some performance
  improvements using \ac{mpmri} techniques instead of mono-parametric imaging
  techniques.
Considering only the most recent studies proposing \ac{cade}-\ac{cadx}
frameworks, the following results can be highlighted.
\citeauthor{Viswanath2011} obtained an \ac{auc} of \SI{77}{\percent} using an
ensemble learning approach combining the features from the three \ac{mri}
modalities --- i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}--\ac{mri}, and
\ac{dw}-\ac{mri}, while the results obtained as standalone modality range from
\SIrange{62}{65}{\percent}~\cite{Viswanath2011}.
\citeauthor{Tiwari2013} drawn similar conclusions by using \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}
and \ac{mrsi} modalities as both in standalone and multi-parametric frameworks
with an improved \ac{auc} ranging from
\SI{57}{\percent}-\SIrange{76}{85}{\percent}~\cite{Tiwari2013}.
The most recent work of \citeauthor{Litjens2014} obtained an improved \ac{auc}
metric from \SI{71}{\percent}-\SI{76}{\percent} considering each modality
separately --- i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, and \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}
--- to \SI{89}{\percent} in their \ac{mpmri} framework.

\item The studies comparing particular combination of more than a single
  modality give rise to the same
  fact~\cite{Ozer2010,Litjens2011,Liu2013,Litjens2014}: using 3 modalities lead
  to better performances than using any combination of 2 modalities.

\item Unlike the previous remark~\ref{here}, no straightforward conclusions can
  be given regarding the classification performance using each modality in a
  standalone framework.
The modality being processed by different methods, it does not allow us to
conclude if a modality by itself is more suited than another.
However, we are able to distinguish some interesting trends which deserve the
attention of the community.
\citeauthor{Tiwari2013} in~\cite{Tiwari2009a,Tiwari2012,Tiwari2013} observed
that \ac{mrsi} is a more suitable modality than \ac{t2w} to highlight
\ac{cap}.
Moreover, \ac{adc} maps have shown a better discriminative power than \ac{t2w}
as well~\cite{Langer2009,Viswanath2011,Peng2013}.
Lately, \citeauthor{Litjens2014} observed that \ac{dw}-\ac{mri} modality is
more suitable than both \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} and \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} to distinguish
\ac{cap} in their \ac{cadx} system~\cite{Litjens2014}.
Recently, \citeauthor{rampun2016computerb} showed, however, some promising
results using \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} only in conjunction with textons and \ac{bow};
this study should be transposed to other \ac{mri}
modalities~\cite{rampun2016computerb}.

\item Furthermore, \ac{mpmri} has attracted the attention of both radiologists
  and computer vision researchers.
Indeed, pioneer research groups included new modalities over years when at the
same time, new research groups directly introduced \ac{mpmri} \ac{cad}
systems.
These facts lead us to think that \ac{cap} researches will benefit from
\ac{mpmri} techniques.

\item When focusing on the different modalities used, it can be pointed out
  that only \citeauthor{trigui2017automatic} reported the use of all modalities
  in a single framework by incorporating the \ac{mrsi}
  modality~\cite{trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic}.
Although the results reported are promising, the detection has been performed
at \ac{mrsi} scale and further investigations need to be carried out.
Nevertheless, \ac{mrsi} has shown some overall good classification performance
at the price of a lower resolution as well as an increased acquisition time.
Moreover, \ac{mrsi} analysis is more complex in comparison with the other
modalities.
To our mind, \ac{mrsi} could contribute in a \ac{mpmri} framework and should be
fused with the other modalities.

\item Lately, 3 studies focused on developing a region-based classification in
  which \ac{pz} and \ac{cg} will be analyzed
  separately~\cite{Viswanath2012,Litjens2012,Litjens2014}.
The promising obtained results indicate that this strategy should be further
investigated.

\item Recent studies are using quantitative features in addition to \ac{si}.
It seems that these quantitative features provide uncorrelated information with
respect to \ac{si} features and should lead to better classification
performance when combined all together.

\item Regarding the methods used in the ``image regularization'' --- i.e.,
  pre-processing, segmentation, and registration --- it is particularly
  difficult to distinguish the benefit of a method over another since none of
  the studies focus on making comparison of these processing stages.
The focus is usually entirely based on the ``image classification'' framework
where different methods are directly compared.
Note that the performance of a classifier is highly linked with the features
vector extracted from particular data.
Hence, one can not conclude that a machine learning method is more appropriate
than another, but we can identify a trend in which \ac{svm} as well as ensemble
learning classifiers --- i.e., AdaBoost, GentleBoost, and \ac{rf} --- seem to
perform better than neural network, \ac{lda}, or Naive Bayes.

\item We would like to draw the attention of the reader on the feature
  extraction/selection stage.
This processing could reduce the complexity and also allow to find a better
feature space for classification.
However, few studies are performing such approaches.
\citeauthor{Niaf2012}, \citeauthor{khalvati2015automated},
\citeauthor{chung2015prostate}, and \citeauthor{rampun2016computer} are
successfully applying a scheme to reduce the number of dimensions by selecting
the most discriminative
features~\cite{Niaf2011,Niaf2012,khalvati2015automated,chung2015prostate,rampun2016computer,rampun2015computer}.
It allows them to obtain improved performances compared with a classification
performed with their initial feature vector.
Another group of studies also applied different feature extraction
methods~\cite{Viswanath2008a,Viswanath2008,Viswanath2012,Tiwari2007,Tiwari2008,Tiwari2009,Tiwari2010,Tiwari2012,Tiwari2013,lehaire2014computer,rampun2016computerb,rampun2015classifying}.
In these specific cases, no comparison is performed against the original data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}\label{subsec:chp3:dis:gen-dis}

This review leads to some general discussions which could direct to future
avenues for research.
As previously mentioned, no open \ac{mpmri} is currently available.
This fact leads to an impossibility to fairly compare the different algorithms
designed over years.
Also, the availability of a full \ac{mpmri} dataset, could lead to the
development of algorithms which use all the different modalities currently
available.
Recalling \acs{tab}~\ref{tab:sumpap}, it can be noted that a single research
work provides a solution using at the same time the 4 different modalities.
Also, all the algorithms are focused on one type of scanner only, either
\SI{1.5}{\tesla} and \SI{3}{\tesla}.
A dataset including both these types of imaging could allow development of more
generic algorithms.

Analyzing the different stages of the \ac{cad} work-flow, it is seen that the
current \ac{cad} systems do not include all the pre-processing steps.
It could be interesting to evaluate the improvement using these pre-processing
steps on the final results.
Regarding segmentation and registration of the prostate, \ac{cad} systems could
greatly benefit from specific research in these areas which could lead to a
better automation of those systems.

Additionally, no research focuses on the problem of imbalanced dataset.
While classifying at the voxel-level, the medical dataset are highly imbalanced
regarding the frequencies of \ac{cap} against healthy samples.
Imbalanced data substantially compromises the learning process since most of
the standard machine learning algorithms expect balanced class distribution or
an equal misclassification cost~\cite{he2009learning}.

Therefore, it seems important to investigate this field of pattern recognition
to improve the classification performance while developing \ac{cad} systems.

Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are to: (i) collect and make
available the first \ac{mpmri} dataset; (ii) design, develop, and investigate a
\ac{cad} system taking advantage of all available \ac{mri} modalities; (iii)
focus on pre-processing methods to improve the classification performance of
\ac{cad} systems; (iv) investigate the problem of imbalanced dataset in the
\ac{cad} performance; (v) release source code to allow future benchmarking.
