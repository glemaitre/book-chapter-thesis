\subsection{Results reported}\label{subsec:chp3:dis:res}

As discussed previously in \ac{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:img-clas:eval-mea},
different metrics have been used to report results.
A comparison of the different methods reviewed is given depending on the metric
used in field of research and also the type of \ac{mri} scanner used,
i.e. \SI{1.5}{\tesla} or \SI{3}{\tesla}.
For each field, the \textit{best classification performance} obtained in each
study have been reported in these figures.
The results in terms of \ac{auc}-\ac{roc} are depicted in
\acs{fig}\,\ref{fig:auc}.
The results vary from \SIrange{71}{97}{\percent} for some experiments with a
\SI{1.5}{\tesla} \ac{mri} scanner and from \SIrange{77}{95}{\percent} with a
\SI{3}{\tesla} \ac{mri} scanner.

The results in regard of sensitivity and specificity are reported in
\acs{fig}\,\ref{fig:sensspec}.
In the case that the data have been collected with a \SI{1.5}{\tesla} \ac{mri}
scanner, the sensitivity ranges from \SIrange{74}{100}{\percent} and the
specificity from \SIrange{43}{93}{\percent}.
For the experiments carried out with a \SI{3}{\tesla} \ac{mri} scanner, the
sensitivity varies from \SIrange{60}{99}{\percent} and the specificity from
\SIrange{66}{100}{\percent}.
Four studies also use \ac{froc} analysis to report their results and are
reported in \ac{fig}\,\ref{fig:froc}.

\subsection{Comparison}\label{subsec:chp3:dis:com}

We would like to stress the following findings drawn during the review of the
different studies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quantitatively, it is difficult to make a fair comparison between the
  different studies reviewed.
  Different factors come into play to elucidate this fact.
  Mainly a lack of standardization has to be pointed out in regard to
  experimental evaluation:
  (i) different datasets are used during the evaluation of the frameworks
  developed hindering an inter-study comparison.
  The same conclusion has been recently drawn by~\cite{Litjens2014} supporting
  this argument;
  (ii) the experimental results are not reported with a common metric which leads
  to the inability to compare the different studies.

\item \label{here} However, multiple studies reported some performance
  improvements using \ac{mpmri} techniques instead of mono-parametric imaging
  techniques.
  Considering only the most recent studies proposing \ac{cade}-\ac{cadx}
  frameworks, the following results can be highlighted.
  \citeauthor{Viswanath2011} obtained an \ac{auc} of \SI{77}{\percent} using an
  ensemble learning approach combining the features from the three \ac{mri}
  modalities --- i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}--\ac{mri}, and
  \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}, while the results obtained as standalone modality range from
  \SIrange{62}{65}{\percent}~\cite{Viswanath2011}.
  \citeauthor{Tiwari2013} drawn similar conclusions by using \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}
  and \ac{mrsi} modalities as both in standalone and multi-parametric frameworks
  with an improved \ac{auc} ranging from
  \SI{57}{\percent}-\SIrange{76}{85}{\percent}~\cite{Tiwari2013}.
  The most recent work of \citeauthor{Litjens2014} obtained an improved \ac{auc}
  metric from \SI{71}{\percent}-\SI{76}{\percent} considering each modality
  separately --- i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, and \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}
  --- to \SI{89}{\percent} in their \ac{mpmri} framework.

\item The studies comparing particular combination of more than a single
  modality give rise to the same
  fact~\cite{Ozer2010,Litjens2011,Liu2013,Litjens2014}: using 3 modalities lead
  to better performances than using any combination of 2 modalities.

\item Unlike the previous remark~\ref{here}, no straightforward conclusions can
  be given regarding the classification performance using each modality in a
  standalone framework.
  The modality being processed by different methods, it does not allow us to
  conclude if a modality by itself is more suited than another.
  However, we are able to distinguish some interesting trends which deserve the
  attention of the community.
  \citeauthor{Tiwari2013} in~\cite{Tiwari2009a,Tiwari2012,Tiwari2013} observed
  that \ac{mrsi} is a more suitable modality than \ac{t2w} to highlight
  \ac{cap}.
  Moreover, \ac{adc} maps have shown a better discriminative power than \ac{t2w}
  as well~\cite{Langer2009,Viswanath2011,Peng2013}.
  Lately, \citeauthor{Litjens2014} observed that \ac{dw}-\ac{mri} modality is
  more suitable than both \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} and \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} to distinguish
  \ac{cap} in their \ac{cadx} system~\cite{Litjens2014}.
  Recently, \citeauthor{rampun2016computerb} showed, however, some promising
  results using \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} only in conjunction with textons and \ac{bow};
  this study should be transposed to other \ac{mri}
  modalities~\cite{rampun2016computerb}.

\item Furthermore, \ac{mpmri} has attracted the attention of both radiologists
  and computer vision researchers.
  Indeed, pioneer research groups included new modalities over years when at the
  same time, new research groups directly introduced \ac{mpmri} \ac{cad}
  systems.
  These facts lead us to think that \ac{cap} researches will benefit from
  \ac{mpmri} techniques.

\item When focusing on the different modalities used, it can be pointed out
  that only \citeauthor{trigui2017automatic} reported the use of all modalities
  in a single framework by incorporating the \ac{mrsi}
  modality~\cite{trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic}.
  Although the results reported are promising, the detection has been performed
  at \ac{mrsi} scale.
  \citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis} performed a similar study but at a finer
  resolution (i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri})~\cite{Lemaitre2016thesis}.
  They concluded that \ac{mrsi} was significantly improving the classification
  performance for \ac{cap} detection.

\item Lately, 3 studies focused on developing a region-based classification in
  which \ac{pz} and \ac{cg} will be analyzed
  separately~\cite{Viswanath2012,Litjens2012,Litjens2014}.
  The promising obtained results indicate that this strategy should be further
  investigated.

\item Recent studies are using quantitative features in addition to \ac{si}.
  It seems that these quantitative features provide uncorrelated information with
  respect to \ac{si} features and should lead to better classification
  performance when combined all together.

\item Regarding the methods used in the ``image regularization'' --- i.e.,
  pre-processing, segmentation, and registration --- it is particularly
  difficult to distinguish the benefit of a method over another since none of
  the studies focus on making comparison of these processing stages.
  The focus is usually entirely based on the ``image classification'' framework
  where different methods are directly compared.
  Note that the performance of a classifier is highly linked with the features
  vector extracted from particular data.
  Hence, one can not conclude that a machine learning method is more appropriate
  than another, but we can identify a trend in which \ac{svm} as well as ensemble
  learning classifiers --- i.e., AdaBoost, GentleBoost, and \ac{rf} --- seem to
  perform better than neural network, \ac{lda}, or Naive Bayes.

\item We would like to draw the attention of the reader on the feature
  extraction/selection stage.
  This processing could reduce the complexity and also allow to find a better
  feature space for classification.
  However, few studies are performing such approaches.
  \citeauthor{Niaf2012}, \citeauthor{khalvati2015automated},
  \citeauthor{chung2015prostate}, \citeauthor{rampun2016computer}, and \citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis} are
  successfully applying a scheme to reduce the number of dimensions by selecting
  the most discriminative
  features~\cite{Niaf2011,Niaf2012,khalvati2015automated,chung2015prostate,rampun2016computer,rampun2015computer,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
  It allows them to obtain improved performances compared with a classification
  performed with their initial feature vector.
  Another group of studies also applied different feature extraction
  methods~\cite{Viswanath2008a,Viswanath2008,Viswanath2012,Tiwari2007,Tiwari2008,Tiwari2009,Tiwari2010,Tiwari2012,Tiwari2013,lehaire2014computer,rampun2016computerb,rampun2015classifying,Lemaitre2016thesis}.
  In these specific cases, no comparison is performed against the original
  data.

\item Currently, only the work of \citeauthor{Lemaitre2016thesis} tackled the
  problem of balancing in dataset.
  They found that balancing can have a positive effect on the classification
  performance.
  In our humble opinion, classification performance would benefit from further
  investigation in this area.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}\label{subsec:chp3:dis:gen-dis}

This review leads to some general discussions which could direct to future
avenues for research.
As previously mentioned, no open \ac{mpmri} is currently available.
This fact leads to an impossibility to fairly compare the different algorithms
designed over years.
Also, the availability of a full \ac{mpmri} dataset, could lead to the
development of algorithms which use all the different modalities currently
available.
Recalling \acs{tab}~\ref{tab:sumpap}, it can be noted that a single research
work provides a solution using at the same time the 4 different modalities.
Also, all the algorithms are focused on one type of scanner only, either
\SI{1.5}{\tesla} and \SI{3}{\tesla}.
A dataset including both these types of imaging could allow development of more
generic algorithms.

Analyzing the different stages of the \ac{cad} work-flow, it is seen that the
current \ac{cad} systems do not include all the pre-processing steps.
It could be interesting to evaluate the improvement using these pre-processing
steps on the final results.
Regarding segmentation and registration of the prostate, \ac{cad} systems could
greatly benefit from specific research in these areas which could lead to a
better automation of those systems.

Additionally, few research works focuses on the problem of imbalanced dataset.
While classifying at the voxel-level, the medical dataset are highly imbalanced
regarding the frequencies of \ac{cap} against healthy samples.
Imbalanced data substantially compromises the learning process since most of
the standard machine learning algorithms expect balanced class distribution or
an equal misclassification cost~\cite{he2009learning}.
Therefore, it seems important to investigate this field of pattern recognition
to improve the classification performance while developing \ac{cad} systems.
